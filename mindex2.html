            <h1 class="title"> Tribute to Sarojini Naidu</h1>
            Sarojini Naidu (née Chattopadhyay; 13 February 1879 – 2 March 1949)[1] was an Indian political activist and poet.
             A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialistic ideas, she was an important figure in India's struggle for 
             independence from colonial rule. Naidu's work as a poet earned her the sobriquet 'the Nightingale of India', 
             or 'Bharat Kokila' by Mahatma Gandhi because of colour, imagery and lyrical quality of her poetry.

            Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Chattopadhyay was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in England,
             where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to Indian National Congress' movement for India's independence from British rule.
              She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj. 
              She married Govindarajulu Naidu, a general physician in 1898. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925
               and later became the Governor of the United Provinces in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the Dominion of India.

            Naidu's     poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, and tragedy. Published in 1912, 
             "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad" remains one of her most popular poems. She died of a cardiac arrest on 2 March 1949..</p></div>
